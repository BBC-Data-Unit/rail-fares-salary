In August 2018 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45174496) that rail commuters in England's biggest cities were spending up to a fifth of their take-home pay on an annual season ticket.

Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit of more than 80 season tickets - based on a commuter using their ticket 228 days a year - covering journeys to London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and Liverpool, found:

* A full time worker on the median wage for one of these cities will spend an average of 11p in every £1 of their salary on an annual pass, after tax
* Commuters from St Albans, Sevenoaks and Harlow travelling to and from London 228 days a year can expect to pay more than 40p for every mile travelled
* Others travelling from East Didsbury and Macclesfield into Manchester and from Bath Spa into Bristol can expect to pay more than 32p per mile of their commute
* A season ticket from Southampton Central to London will cost £5,885, which is over a fifth of the average full-time take-home wage for London, £28,685
* Someone living in Cambridge and working in London will pay more than £5,000 for an annual pass, up from £4,952 in 2018
* Season tickets will have risen an average of 9% since 2016

The story involved working out the distances between stations and then taking that cost, the mileage and a 228-day working year. It also saw the first use of a dumbbell chart by the unit, produced in R by **Dan Wainwright**. 

This is the fourth story the data unit has done on rail fare rises. 12 months ago, in August 2017, we published [Rail fares: Commuters to pay £100 more in 2018](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-ticket-rises-2018). In January 2017, when price rises come into effect, we published [Rail fares: Who are the season ticket winners and losers?](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-ticket-rises) and 2 years ago, in September 2016, we published [Rail season tickets cost 10% of net pay](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-tickets).
